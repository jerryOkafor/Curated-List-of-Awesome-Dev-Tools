# Usefull Chrome DevTools And Plugins for Android Developer!
## 1. Stetho
Stetho is a sophisticated debug bridge for Android applications. When enabled, developers have access to the Chrome Developer Tools feature natively part of the Chrome desktop browser. Developers can also choose to enable the optional dumpapp tool which offers a powerful command-line interface to application internals.
	The integration with the Chrome DevTools frontend is implemented using a client/server protocol which the Stetho software provides for your application. Once your application is integrated, simply navigate to chrome://inspect and click "Inspect" to get started!

## 2. Android Search

Adds an 'ad' omnibox command and view source links for the Android SDK.
This very simple extension does two things:

1. Adds an 'ad' command to the Chrome Omnibox. For example, typing 'ad ViewGro' will bring up a list of all class names in the Android SDK matching 'ViewGro'â€”selecting a list item navigates to the relevant Android SDK Reference URL on developer.android.com.

2. Adds a '(view source)' link next to the SDK class name for class reference pages on developer.android.com. Clicking this link navigates to the relevant Google Code Search results from android.git.kernel.org.
